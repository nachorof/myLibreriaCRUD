# My Libreria

This project is about recording all books in a database. My personal aim is to:
* Learn some python
* Use a sqlite database
* Learn how to work with Qt5 (even at so beginner level)
* Use git

### Prerequisites

Just python 3 

## Built With

* [Python3](https://www.python.org/) - Python programming language
